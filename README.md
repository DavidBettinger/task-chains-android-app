# Task-Chain Android App

An app to work on and complete task in a fixed order.



## Introduction

The purpose of this app is, to work together with other people on completing lists (chains)

of tasks. These task-chains can be created with my [Task-Chains web app](https://github.com/DavidBettinger/task-chains) build with Java Spring Boot.

My aim for this project is primarily to learn how to build good android app with kotlin. 



### Examples of use

A task-chain could represent the incorporation of a new employee in a company.

The different tasks in this chain could then consist of:

1. Introduce the new employee to his/her co-workers
2. Explain the workflow of the company
3. Train the employee to use specific computer programs
4. ...



### Planned and implemented functionalities 

At the moment this project is in a very early development stage. So far you can:

- Use the "fake" login (real login is not yet implemented on the server side)
- Load the avaible task-chains from the server
- Navigate between the task-chains and tasks
- Add comments to tasks and save them on the device



There are many more features I plan to add to the app. At the moment the most important ones are:



- 
- Titles and internal titles
- Introduction - the project's aim
- Technologies
- Launch


Consider also using additional elements such as: 

- Table of contents
- Illustrations
- Scope of functionalities 
- Examples of use
- Project status 
- Sources
- Other information
